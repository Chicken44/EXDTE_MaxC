# If Staments & While Loops 

# We can use 'if' statements to excute code if a given condition is met.
# To check if two variables are the same we use DOUBLE equals (==)
# Python is case sensitive. 'Hello' is not the same as 'hello'.
# We can get around this by using .lower()
# While loops are useful when we want the program to loop until a given condition is met but we dont know
#  how many times it needs to loop

# If Statements!
#create a variable to loop my code
like_coffee = input("Do you like coffee? ").lower()
#while variable is empty keep looping
while keep_going == '':
if like_coffee == "yes" or like_coffee == "y":
  print("I like coffee too!")
elif like_coffee == "no" or like_coffee == "n":
  print("You are missing out!")
else:
  print("I dont understand!")
keep_going = input("press <enter> to continue or any key to quit")
print()
